<purpose>
Execute all tasks in a phase plan using wave-based parallel execution with dependency-aware ordering. Invoked after Skill({ skill: "maestro-plan" }) produces a confirmed plan.json. Produces task summaries, updated task statuses, commits, and execution progress in index.json.
</purpose>

<context>
Phase: $ARGUMENTS (required -- phase number or slug)

**Flags:**
- `--auto-commit` -- Automatically commit after each task completion
- `--method agent|cli` -- Override execution method (default: from config.json or index.json)
- `--dir <path>` -- Use arbitrary directory instead of phase resolution (scratch mode, skip roadmap validation)

Context files resolved from `.workflow/phases/{NN}-{slug}/` (or `--dir` path):
- index.json (phase metadata + plan.waves + execution progress)
- plan.json (plan overview)
- .task/TASK-{NNN}.json (individual task definitions, lazy-loaded per wave)

**executionContext handoff:** If received from Skill({ skill: "maestro-plan" }) confirmation, skip disk reload and use in-memory plan + explorations + clarifications.
</context>

<execution>
### Pre-flight: team conflict check

Before any task execution, run:
```
Bash("maestro team preflight --phase <phase-number>")
```
If exit code is 1, the command prints warnings about teammates active on the same phase. Present the warnings to the user and ask whether to proceed. If the user confirms or says "force", continue. If they decline, abort with a clear message.

If exit code is 0, or `maestro team preflight` is unavailable (e.g., team mode not enabled), continue normally.

Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/execute.md' completely.

**Report format on completion:**

```
=== EXECUTION COMPLETE ===
Phase:     {phase_name}
Completed: {completed_count}/{total_count} tasks
Failed:    {failed_count} tasks
Waves:     {waves_executed}/{total_waves}

Summaries: {phase_dir}/.summaries/
Tasks:     {phase_dir}/.task/

Next steps:
  Skill({ skill: "maestro-verify", args: "{phase}" })  -- Verify execution results
  Skill({ skill: "manage-status" })          -- View project dashboard
```

If this was a gap-fix execution (plan originated from `--gaps`), emphasize re-verification:
  "Gap-fix execution complete. Run Skill({ skill: "maestro-verify", args: "{phase}" }) to confirm gaps are resolved."

If failed tasks exist, suggest Skill({ skill: "quality-debug" }) for investigation.
