<purpose>
Perform multi-dimensional analysis of a technical proposal, decision, or architecture choice through iterative CLI-assisted exploration and interactive discussion. Produces a discussion timeline (discussion.md) with evolving understanding, multi-perspective findings, Decision Recording Protocol, Intent Coverage tracking, and a final conclusions package with Go/No-Go recommendation.

Combines structured 6-dimension scoring with iterative deepening and decision extraction. Replaces both analysis and decision-capture workflows — produces analysis.md (scoring) AND context.md (Locked/Free/Deferred decisions for plan).

Use `-q` for quick decision extraction only (skip exploration + scoring).

- [scratch-index.json](~/.maestro/templates/scratch-index.json) — read when operating in scratch mode
- [index.json](~/.maestro/templates/index.json) — read when operating in phase mode
</deferred_reading>

<context>
$ARGUMENTS -- phase number for phase mode, topic text for scratch mode, with optional flags.

**Flags:**
- `-y` / `--yes`: Auto mode — skip interactive scoping, use recommended defaults, auto-deepen
- `-c` / `--continue`: Resume from existing session (auto-detect session folder + discussion.md)
- `-q` / `--quick`: Quick mode — skip exploration + scoring, go straight to decision extraction (context.md only)

**Phase mode** (number): resolves phase directory from state.json + roadmap, updates index.json status to "exploring".
**Scratch mode** (text): creates `.workflow/scratch/analyze-{slug}-{date}/` with index.json from scratch-index template (type="analyze").

**Output artifacts:**
| Artifact | Mode | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `context.md` | both | Locked/Free/Deferred decisions for downstream plan |
| `discussion.md` | full | Full discussion timeline with TOC, Current Understanding, rounds, decisions, intent coverage |
| `analysis.md` | full | Executive summary with 6-dimension scores and risk matrix |
| `conclusions.json` | full | Final synthesis with recommendations, decision trail, intent coverage |
| `explorations.json` | full | Codebase exploration findings (single perspective) |
| `perspectives.json` | full | Multi-perspective findings with synthesis (if multi-perspective) |

| Code | Severity | Condition | Recovery |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| E001 | error | Analysis subject required (no arguments provided) | Prompt user for phase number or topic text |
| E002 | error | Phase directory not found | List available phases, prompt user to select |
| W001 | warning | CLI exploration failed | Continue with available context, note limitation |
| W002 | warning | CLI analysis timeout | Retry with shorter prompt, or skip perspective |
| W003 | warning | Insufficient evidence for scoring dimensions | Note low-confidence dimensions, proceed with available evidence |
| W004 | warning | Max rounds reached (5) | Force synthesis, offer continuation option |
