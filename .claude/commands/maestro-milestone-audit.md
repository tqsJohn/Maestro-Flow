<purpose>
Audit milestone completion with cross-phase integration checks. Identifies which phases belong to the milestone, spawns a workflow-integration-checker agent to validate that all phases work together correctly (shared interfaces, data contracts, dependency chains), and produces an audit report with gap analysis and fix suggestions.
</purpose>

<context>
Milestone: $ARGUMENTS (optional -- defaults to current_milestone from state.json).

**Requires:** All phases in the milestone should be completed or verifying.

**State files:**
- `.workflow/state.json` -- current_milestone, phases_completed
- `.workflow/roadmap.md` -- milestone-to-phase mapping
- `.workflow/phases/{NN}-{slug}/index.json` -- phase metadata per phase
- `.workflow/phases/{NN}-{slug}/verification.json` -- phase verification results
</context>

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/milestone-audit.md' completely.

**Next-step routing on completion:**
- Verdict PASS → Skill({ skill: "maestro-milestone-complete", args: "{milestone}" })
- Verdict FAIL, integration gaps → Skill({ skill: "maestro-plan", args: "{affected_phase} --gaps" })
- Verdict FAIL, incomplete phases → Skill({ skill: "maestro-execute", args: "{incomplete_phase}" })
</execution>
