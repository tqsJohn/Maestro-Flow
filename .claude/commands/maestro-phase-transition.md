<purpose>
Transition from one phase to the next after verification passes. Validates that the current phase meets all completion criteria (tasks done, verification passed, no unresolved gaps), marks it complete in the phase index, and advances the project state to the next phase. If the next phase directory does not exist, it is created and initialized.

$ARGUMENTS -- phase number to transition from (optional, defaults to current_phase from state.json).

**Flags:**
- `--force` -- Skip gap check and force transition even with warnings

**State files:**
- `.workflow/state.json` -- project-level state (current_phase, milestones)
- `.workflow/phases/{NN}-{slug}/index.json` -- phase metadata and status
- `.workflow/phases/{NN}-{slug}/verification.json` -- verification results
- `.workflow/phases/{NN}-{slug}/review.json` -- code review results (if exists)
</context>

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/phase-transition.md' completely.

**Next-step routing on completion:**
- Next phase exists, ready to plan → Skill({ skill: "maestro-plan", args: "{next_phase}" })
- Next phase needs analysis first → Skill({ skill: "maestro-analyze", args: "{next_phase}" })
- Next phase needs UI design → Skill({ skill: "maestro-ui-design", args: "{next_phase}" })
- All phases in milestone complete → Skill({ skill: "maestro-milestone-audit" })
- View updated dashboard → Skill({ skill: "manage-status" })
</execution>
