<purpose>
Run a self-iterating integration test cycle that combines exploration, test design, test execution, reflection, and adaptive strategy adjustment. Unlike quality-test (UAT with user) or quality-test-gen (generate missing tests), this command runs automated integration tests in a closed loop that self-corrects until convergence.

Key mechanisms from DMS3 integration-test-cycle:
- **6-phase cycle**: Explore -> Design -> Develop -> Test -> Reflect -> Adjust
- **Reflection-driven**: After each iteration, reflect on what worked/failed and adjust strategy
- **Adaptive strategy engine**: Conservative (iter 1-2) -> Aggressive (>80% similar) -> Surgical (regression) -> Reflective (stuck 3+)
- **L0-L3 progressive layers**: Static Analysis -> Unit -> Integration -> E2E
- **Self-iterating**: Loop continues until pass rate threshold met or max iterations reached
- **State persistence**: state.json + reflection-log.md survive context resets

<context>
Phase: $ARGUMENTS (required -- phase number)

**Flags:**
- `--max-iter <N>` -- Maximum iterations (default: 5)
- `--layer <L0|L1|L2|L3>` -- Start from specific layer (default: auto-detect)

**L0-L3 Progressive Test Layers:**

| Layer | Name | What | Tools |
|-------|------|------|-------|
| L0 | Static Analysis | Type checking, lint, dead code | `tsc --noEmit`, `eslint`, `ruff` |
| L1 | Unit Tests | Function-level isolation tests | jest, vitest, pytest |
| L2 | Integration Tests | Cross-module, API, DB tests | supertest, pytest + fixtures |
| L3 | E2E Tests | Full user flow tests | playwright, cypress, selenium |

**State files (in `.tests/integration/`):**
- `state.json` -- iteration state, pass rates, strategy
- `reflection-log.md` -- per-iteration reflections
- `test-results-iter-{N}.json` -- results per iteration
</context>

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/integration-test.md' completely.

**Next-step routing on completion:**
- Converged (pass rate met) → Skill({ skill: "maestro-phase-transition", args: "{phase}" })
- Max iterations, pass rate close → Skill({ skill: "quality-debug", args: "{phase}" }) (investigate remaining failures)
- Regressions detected → Skill({ skill: "quality-debug", args: "{phase}" })
- Stuck 3+ iterations → Skill({ skill: "maestro-analyze", args: "{phase} -q" }) (reassess approach)
</execution>
