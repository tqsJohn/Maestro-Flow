<purpose>
Create a verified execution plan (plan.json + .task/TASK-*.json) for a roadmap phase through a 5-stage pipeline: Exploration, Clarification, Planning, Plan Checking, and Confirmation. Invoked when a phase is ready to be planned after init/brainstorm. Produces plan.json with waves, task definitions, and user-confirmed execution strategy.

<deferred_reading>
- [plan.json](~/.maestro/templates/plan.json) — read when generating plan output
- [task.json](~/.maestro/templates/task.json) — read when generating task files
- [index.json](~/.maestro/templates/index.json) — read when updating phase index
</deferred_reading>

<context>
Phase: $ARGUMENTS (required -- phase number or slug)

**Flags:**
- `--collab` -- Multi-planner collaborative mode (spawn N workflow-collab-planner agents with pre-allocated TASK ID ranges)
- `--spec SPEC-xxx` -- Reference a task-spec for requirements input
- `--auto` -- Skip interactive clarification (P2), use defaults
- `--gaps` -- Gap closure mode: load verification.json gaps, skip exploration, plan only gap fixes
- `--dir <path>` -- Use arbitrary directory instead of phase resolution (scratch mode, skip roadmap validation)

Context files resolved from `.workflow/phases/{NN}-{slug}/` (or `--dir` path):
- context.md (user decisions from Skill({ skill: "maestro-analyze" }))
- index.json (phase metadata)
- spec-ref from index.json (if set)
- codebase/doc-index.json (if exists)
</context>

<execution>
### Pre-flight: team conflict check

Before starting the plan pipeline, run:
```
Bash("maestro team preflight --phase <phase-number>")
```
If exit code is 1, the command prints warnings about teammates active on the same phase. Present the warnings to the user and ask whether to proceed. If the user confirms or says "force", continue. If they decline, abort with a clear message.

If exit code is 0, or `maestro team preflight` is unavailable (e.g., team mode not enabled), continue normally.

Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/plan.md' completely.

**Report format on completion:**

```
=== PLAN READY ===
Phase: {phase_name}
Tasks: {task_count} tasks in {wave_count} waves
Check: {checker_status} (iteration {check_count}/{max_checks})

Plan: {phase_dir}/plan.json
Tasks: {phase_dir}/.task/TASK-*.json

Next steps:
  Skill({ skill: "maestro-execute", args: "{phase}" })  -- Execute the plan
  Skill({ skill: "maestro-plan", args: "{phase}" })     -- Re-plan with modifications

Note: If this was a --gaps plan, after execute run Skill({ skill: "maestro-verify", args: "{phase}" }) to confirm gaps are closed.
```
</execution>
