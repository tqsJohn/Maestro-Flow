<purpose>
Verify phase execution results through three complementary methods:
1. **Goal-Backward verification** — 3-layer check (Truths → Artifacts → Wiring) that validates goals are actually achieved, not just tasks completed
2. **Anti-pattern scan** — detect stubs, placeholders, TODO/FIXME, empty returns in modified files
3. **Nyquist test coverage validation** — requirement-to-test mapping with gap classification (COVERED/PARTIAL/MISSING)

Core principle: **Task completion ≠ Goal achievement**. A task "create chat component" can be marked complete when the component is a placeholder. This verifier checks that the goal "working chat interface" is actually achieved.

Produces verification.json with must-have checks, gaps, anti-patterns, and fix plans. Optionally produces validation.json with test coverage analysis.

<context>
Phase: $ARGUMENTS (required -- phase number or slug)

**Flags:**
- `--skip-tests` -- Skip Nyquist test coverage validation (V2), only run Goal-Backward verification
- `--skip-antipattern` -- Skip anti-pattern scan

Context files resolved from `.workflow/phases/{NN}-{slug}/`:
- index.json (phase metadata, success_criteria, plan, execution results)
- plan.json (task overview)
- .task/TASK-{NNN}.json (task definitions with convergence.criteria)
- .summaries/TASK-{NNN}-summary.md (execution results)
</context>

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/verify.md' completely.

**Next-step routing on completion:**
- All checks pass, no gaps → Skill({ skill: "quality-review", args: "{phase}" })
- Gaps found (must-have failures or anti-pattern blockers) → Skill({ skill: "maestro-plan", args: "{phase} --gaps" })
- Low test coverage (Nyquist gaps) → Skill({ skill: "quality-test-gen", args: "{phase}" })

**Gap-fix closure loop:**
Gaps found → maestro-plan --gaps → maestro-execute → maestro-verify (re-run)
</execution>
