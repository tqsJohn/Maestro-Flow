<purpose>
Generate missing automated tests for a phase based on gap analysis from maestro-verify (Nyquist audit) and quality-test (UAT coverage gaps). Classifies changed files into unit test vs E2E vs skip categories, discovers existing test infrastructure, generates a test plan for user approval, then writes tests using RED-GREEN methodology.

Key mechanisms from GSD add-tests:
- **TDD/E2E/Skip classification**: Categorize changed files by appropriate test type
- **Test structure discovery**: Find existing test patterns, frameworks, conventions
- **Test plan with user approval**: Present plan before writing any tests
- **RED-GREEN generation**: Write failing test first, verify it targets the right behavior
- **Bug discovery, not fix**: Tests expose bugs; fixing is for quality-debug or maestro-execute

This command is the "test gap filler" -- it bridges the gap between verification (maestro-verify finds MISSING coverage) and testing (quality-test runs UAT). It produces the automated tests that make Nyquist coverage pass.

<context>
Phase: $ARGUMENTS (required -- phase number)

**Flags:**
- `--layer <unit|e2e|all>` -- Generate only specific test layer (default: all)

Context files:
- `.workflow/phases/{NN}-{slug}/verification.json` -- Nyquist gaps (MISSING/PARTIAL)
- `.workflow/phases/{NN}-{slug}/validation.json` -- requirement-to-test mapping
- `.workflow/phases/{NN}-{slug}/.tests/coverage-report.json` -- UAT coverage gaps
- `.workflow/phases/{NN}-{slug}/.summaries/TASK-*.md` -- what was built
</context>

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/test-gen.md' completely.

**Next-step routing on completion:**
- All tests pass → Skill({ skill: "quality-test", args: "{phase}" })
- Bugs discovered (failing tests) → Skill({ skill: "quality-debug", args: "{phase}" })
- Regressions in existing tests → Skill({ skill: "quality-debug", args: "{phase}" })
- Coverage still low → Skill({ skill: "quality-test-gen", args: "{phase} --layer {missing_layer}" })
</execution>
