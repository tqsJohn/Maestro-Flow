<purpose>
Execute a planned solution for a specific issue. Supports dual-mode dispatch:

- **Server UP**: POST to `/api/execution/dispatch` for orchestrated execution
- **Server DOWN**: Direct execution via `maestro cli` with the solution prompt

Options:
- **--executor**: Agent to execute the solution (default: claude-code)
- **--dry-run**: Display the constructed prompt and steps without executing

For issue CRUD, use `/manage-issue`. For analysis, use `/manage-issue-analyze`. For planning, use `/manage-issue-plan`.
</purpose>
