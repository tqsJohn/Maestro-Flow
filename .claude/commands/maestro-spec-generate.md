<purpose>
Transform an idea, brainstorm output, or user requirements into a complete specification package through a 7-phase document chain: Discovery → Requirement Clarification → Product Brief → PRD → Architecture → Epics & Stories → Readiness Check → Roadmap Generation. Outputs a validated specification package with roadmap in `.workflow/.spec/` and writes `.workflow/roadmap.md` for downstream execution.

This is the heavy-path entry for structured decomposition: idea → spec-generate (spec + roadmap) → init → plan → execute.
</purpose>

$ARGUMENTS -- idea text, @file reference to requirements document, or brainstorm session reference.

**Flags:**
- `-y` / `--yes`: Auto mode — skip interactive questions, use recommended defaults
- `-c` / `--continue`: Resume from last checkpoint (reads spec-config.json)
- `--count N`: Limit number of exploration dimensions (default 5)
- `--from-brainstorm SESSION-ID`: Import guidance-specification.md from a brainstorm session as seed

**Input types:**
- Direct text: `"Build a real-time collaboration platform"`
- File reference: `@requirements.md` or `@design-brief.txt`
- Brainstorm import: `--from-brainstorm WFS-xxx` (reads `.workflow/scratch/brainstorm-*/` or `.workflow/phases/*/`)

**Output location:** `.workflow/.spec/SPEC-{slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}/`

**Relationship to pipeline:**
```
maestro-brainstorm (optional upstream)
        ↓ guidance-specification.md
maestro-init (REQUIRED first step — project setup)
        ↓ project.md, state.json, config.json
maestro-spec-generate (this command — heavy path)
        ↓ spec package + roadmap.md → .workflow/roadmap.md
maestro-plan → maestro-execute → maestro-verify

Alternative light path (skip spec-generate):
maestro-init → maestro-roadmap → roadmap.md directly
```
**Note:** `maestro-init` MUST run before this command. It creates the `.workflow/` directory and project context that spec-generate builds upon.
</context>

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/spec-generate.md' completely.

**Next-step routing on completion:**
- Roadmap generated, ready to plan → Skill({ skill: "maestro-plan", args: "1" })
- Need UI design first → Skill({ skill: "maestro-ui-design", args: "1" })
- Need analysis before planning → Skill({ skill: "maestro-analyze", args: "1" })
- View project dashboard → Skill({ skill: "manage-status" })
</execution>
