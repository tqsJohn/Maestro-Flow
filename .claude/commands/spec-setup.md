<purpose>
Initialize the project-level specs directory by scanning the codebase for conventions, patterns, and tech stack.
Produces four spec files plus a tech profile JSON that downstream agents and commands consume for consistent coding.
All output lands in `.workflow/specs/` and `.workflow/project-tech.json`.

$ARGUMENTS (no arguments expected)

**Preconditions:**
- `.workflow/` directory must exist (created by Skill({ skill: "maestro-init" }))  # (see code: E001)
- Project must contain source files to scan  # (see code: E002)
</context>

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/specs-setup.md' completely.
</execution>

<error_codes>
| Code | Severity | Description | Stage |
|------|----------|-------------|-------|
| E001 | fatal | `.workflow/` directory not initialized -- run Skill({ skill: "maestro-init" }) first | parse_input |
| E002 | fatal | No source files found in project -- nothing to scan | scan_codebase |
| W001 | warning | Convention detection uncertain for one or more categories -- marked `[UNCERTAIN]` | generate_specs |
</error_codes>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] `.workflow/specs/` directory created
- [ ] `coding-conventions.md` written with detected patterns
- [ ] `architecture-constraints.md` written with structural rules
- [ ] `quality-rules.md` written with auto-detected and manual sections
- [ ] `learnings.md` initialized with format instructions
- [ ] `project-tech.json` written with detected tech stack
- [ ] Report displayed with summary and next steps:
  - Build codebase docs → Skill({ skill: "spec-map" })
  - Load specs for task → Skill({ skill: "spec-load" })
  - Add new knowledge → Skill({ skill: "spec-add", args: "<type> <content>" })
