<purpose>
Create a project roadmap through interactive requirement decomposition and iterative refinement. This is the lightweight path for structured decomposition — directly from requirements to roadmap without full specification documents. For the heavy path with formal specs, use maestro-spec-generate instead.

Produces `.workflow/roadmap.md` with milestone/phase structure ready for maestro-plan.

<context>
$ARGUMENTS -- requirement text, @file reference, or brainstorm session reference.

**Flags:**
- `-y` / `--yes`: Auto mode — skip interactive questions, use recommended defaults
- `-c` / `--continue`: Resume from last checkpoint
- `-m progressive|direct|auto`: Decomposition strategy (default: auto)
- `--from-brainstorm SESSION-ID`: Import guidance-specification.md from a brainstorm session as seed

**Input types:**
- Direct text: `"Implement user authentication system with OAuth and 2FA"`
- File reference: `@requirements.md`
- Brainstorm import: `--from-brainstorm WFS-xxx`

**Relationship to pipeline:**
```
maestro-brainstorm (optional upstream)
        ↓ guidance-specification.md
maestro-init (project setup — no roadmap)
        ↓ project.md, state.json, config.json
maestro-roadmap (this command — light path)
        ↓ roadmap.md → .workflow/roadmap.md
maestro-plan → maestro-execute → maestro-verify

Alternative heavy path (skip maestro-roadmap):
maestro-init → maestro-spec-generate → spec package + roadmap.md
```

**Dual modes:**
| Mode | Strategy | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| Progressive | MVP → Usable → Refined → Optimized | High uncertainty, need validation |
| Direct | Topological task sequence | Clear requirements, confirmed tech |

Auto-selection: ≥3 high uncertainty factors → Progressive, ≥3 low → Direct, else → ask user.
</context>

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/roadmap.md' completely.

**Next-step routing on completion:**
- Roadmap approved, ready to plan → Skill({ skill: "maestro-plan", args: "1" })
- Need UI design first → Skill({ skill: "maestro-ui-design", args: "1" })
- Need analysis before planning → Skill({ skill: "maestro-analyze", args: "1" })
- View project dashboard → Skill({ skill: "manage-status" })
</execution>
