<purpose>
Mark a milestone as complete after its audit has passed. Validates that the audit report exists and shows a passing verdict, archives the milestone by updating state.json, generates a milestone summary document capturing key outcomes and learnings, and prepares the project state for the next milestone.
</purpose>

<required_reading>
@~/.maestro/workflows/milestone-complete.md
</required_reading>

<context>
Milestone: $ARGUMENTS (optional -- defaults to current_milestone from state.json).

**Requires:** Skill({ skill: "maestro-milestone-audit" }) should have passed (all phases completed, no integration gaps).

**State files:**
- `.workflow/state.json` -- current_milestone, milestones array
- `.workflow/roadmap.md` -- milestone structure
- `.workflow/milestones/{milestone}/audit-report.md` -- audit results
</context>

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/milestone-complete.md' completely.

**Next-step routing on completion:**
- Next milestone has phases → Skill({ skill: "maestro-plan", args: "{next_milestone_first_phase}" })
- Need to capture learnings → Skill({ skill: "manage-memory-capture", args: "compact" })
- View updated project state → Skill({ skill: "manage-status" })
</execution>
